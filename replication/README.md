[Caravello and Mart√≠nez Bruera (2024)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c7op8jjij1z90mq148bb4/nonlinear_lp.pdf?rlkey=ykqfdvk3gpz1m9wcqscrm3cg5&e=3&dl=0) find little evidence for asymmetry in the transmission of oil news shocks. [Forni et al. (forthcoming, QE)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HN8p4fcvv1YQFO_lUXcX4wjTmW3tO9YV/view) do find evidence using a non-linear VAR. The replication code shows that the indicator function approach largely confers with the CMB findings ([see their replication code](https://github.com/tcaravello/sign_size/tree/d749ebd2b1aa0d46cb1e243e228542913c70a3ed)). 

Forni et al. provide a nice discussion of how we might resolve the discrepensy, which arises from two seperate identification approaches. Their non-linear VAR places a functional form restriction on the shock and requires partial invertability, whereas the proxy identification approach can be biased when the proxy is actually a composition of several imperfectly measured structural shocks (see also [Koo, Lee, and Seo, 2024](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z2X-B0l71qRB9oL_3sml5eLipJrJT-kA/view)). Ultimately, both approaches are sensitive to reasonable perturbations in identifying assumptions, so the methodological decision is especially subjective in this case. Given sample size limitations, the recent [Montiel Olea et al. survey](https://www.mikkelpm.com/files/lp_var_primer.pdf) (2025 NBER Macroeconomics Annual) suggests its broadly advantageous to perform estimation in more stripped down specifications.
